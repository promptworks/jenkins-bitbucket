<% if message[:pull_request].story_number -%>
# No job on Jenkins

As far as I can tell, there isn't a job on Jenkins for story number <%= message[:pull_request].story_number %>.

To fix this, run a job on Jenkins that has "<%= message[:pull_request].story_number %>" in the name.
<%- else -%>
# No story number

In order to connect this pull request to a job on Jenkins, please put the story number in the title. Once that's done, <%= refresh_link(message[:pull_request]) %>.
<% end %>
